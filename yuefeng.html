<h1>Angel</h1>
<h2>Sarah McLachlan</h2>
<p>Spend all your time waiting<br/>
for that second chance<br/>
for a break that would make it okay<br/>
there's always some reason<br/>
to feel not good enough<br/>
and it's hard at the end of the day<br/>
I need some distraction<br/>
oh beautiful release<br/>
memories seep from my veins<br/>
let me be empty<br/>
and weightless and maybe<br/>
I'll find some peace tonight<br/>
<br/>
in the arms of the angel<br/>
fly away from here<br/>
from this dark cold hotel room<br/>
and the endlessness that you fear<br/>
you are pulled from the wreckage<br/>
of your silent reverie<br/>
you're in the arms of the angel<br/>
may you find some comfort here<br/>
<br/>
so tired of the straight line<br/>
and everywhere you turn<br/>
there's vultures and thieves at your back<br/>
and the storm keeps on twisting<br/>
you keep on building the lies<br/>
that you make up for all that you lack<br/>
it don't make no difference<br/>
escaping one last time<br/>
it's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh<br/>
this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees<br/>
<br/>
in the arms of the angel<br/>
fly away from here<br/>
from this dark cold hotel room<br/>
and the endlessness that you fear<br/>
you are pulled from the wreckage<br/>
of your silent reverie<br/>
you're in the arms of the angel<br/>
may you find some comfort here<br/>
you're in the arms of the angel<br/>
may you find some comfort here</p>
